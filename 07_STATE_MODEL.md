# CNIG State Model

Constraint-Native Infrastructure Governance (CNIG)

---

## 1. Purpose of This Layer

This layer defines how CNIG models system state, state evolution, and state transitions under composition.

It describes how systems are reasoned about over structural change, not how systems are executed.

This is a **conceptual state model**, not a runtime state machine.

---

## 2. Nature of the State Model

The CNIG state model is:

- a structural representation of system possibility
- a way to reason about transitions under composition
- a mapping between structure and potential outcomes

It is not:

- a runtime state machine
- an orchestration model
- an execution workflow engine
- a deterministic system simulator

---

## 3. System State Definition

A CNIG system state represents:

- the structural configuration of components
- the relationships between system entities
- the constraints governing admissibility at a given moment

A state is not an execution snapshot.

It is a **structural configuration in a compositional space**.

---

## 4. State Categories

### 4.1 Reachable State
A state that can emerge through valid composition of system components.

Reachability is determined by structural interaction, not execution flow.

---

### 4.2 Admissible State
A reachable state that remains coherent under CNIG constraints.

Admissibility reflects structural stability, not runtime correctness.

---

### 4.3 Transitional State
A state representing movement between two structural configurations.

Transitions are conceptual mappings between configurations, not execution steps.

---

### 4.4 Invalid State (CNIG Perspective)
A state that violates structural admissibility under composition constraints.

Invalidity is defined by structural inconsistency, not runtime failure.

---

## 5. State Transition Model

State transitions describe how one system configuration can transform into another under composition pressure.

A transition is evaluated by:

- whether it preserves structural coherence
- whether it expands or contracts reachable state space
- whether it introduces new interaction topology (Privilege Surface effects)

Transitions are not executed — they are **reasoned about**.

---

## 6. Structural Time Principle

CNIG does not assume time as an execution axis.

Instead, it treats change as:

- reconfiguration of structural relationships
- movement across a compositional space of possibilities

Time is an interpretive dimension, not a control mechanism.

---

## 7. Relationship to Primitives

The state model is built on CNIG primitives:

- Reachable State Space defines the boundary of all possible states
- Admissible System State defines the valid subset
- Privilege Surface modifies transition potential
- Constraint-Native Governance shapes structural boundaries
- Execution vs Governance Separation ensures state is not confused with runtime behavior

---

## 8. Non-Execution Clause

The CNIG state model must not be interpreted as:

- a runtime state engine
- a workflow execution system
- a simulation framework
- a system orchestration model

It remains strictly a conceptual representation.

## 9. Transition to Architecture Patterns

The next layer describes how structural composition patterns manifest under CNIG.
