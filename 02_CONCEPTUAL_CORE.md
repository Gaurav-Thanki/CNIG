# CNIG Conceptual Core

Constraint-Native Infrastructure Governance (CNIG)

---

## 1. Core Definition

Constraint-Native Infrastructure Governance (CNIG) by Gaurav H. Thanki is a conceptual framework for reasoning about admissible system states within reachable state space under composition constraints prior to execution.

CNIG defines system behavior at the level of **compositional structure**, rather than individual component correctness.

It is concerned with how system architecture shapes the space of possible outcomes before execution occurs.

---

## 2. Core Problem Space

CNIG addresses a recurring condition in distributed systems:

> systems composed of locally correct components can produce globally invalid or unstable outcomes

This occurs when:

- correctness is verified at component boundaries
- but system behavior emerges through interaction topology
- rather than isolated execution paths

CNIG focuses on this gap between:

- local correctness
- and global compositional behavior

---

## 3. System Perspective Shift

CNIG introduces a shift in reasoning focus:

From:
- “Is this component correct?”

To:
- “What system states become reachable when correct components interact?”

This shift moves analysis from execution-level correctness to structure-induced possibility space.

---

## 4. Conceptual Structure

CNIG is organized around three structural dimensions:

### 4.1 Composition Space
The system is treated as a space of interacting components where relationships define behavior.

### 4.2 Reachability Space
Not all theoretically possible states are equally accessible under system structure.

CNIG reasons about which states become reachable under composition.

### 4.3 Admissibility Space
A subset of reachable states that are structurally coherent under constraints.

CNIG distinguishes between:

- reachable states
- and admissible states

---

## 5. Interpretation Principle

CNIG does not evaluate correctness directly.

Instead, it evaluates:

- how system structure reshapes the boundary between possible and admissible outcomes

This makes CNIG a structural reasoning framework rather than a validation system.

---

## 6. Relationship to Execution

CNIG operates prior to execution reasoning.

It does not model runtime behavior directly.

Instead, it models the structural conditions that determine what execution can produce.

Execution is an outcome of structure, not the input to CNIG.

---

## 7. Non-Implementation Clause

CNIG is not:

- a runtime system
- a policy enforcement engine
- a verification framework
- a deployment architecture

Any implementation that references CNIG is an external projection of its concepts, not CNIG itself.

## 8. Transition to Next Layer

The next layer defines the internal vocabulary used to reason about CNIG systems:

- invariants
- primitives
- structural references
