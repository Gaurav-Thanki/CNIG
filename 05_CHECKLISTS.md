# CNIG Checklists

Constraint-Native Infrastructure Governance (CNIG)

---

## 1. Purpose of This Layer

This layer defines structured reasoning checklists used to evaluate system behavior through the CNIG lens.

These checklists are designed for **pre-execution analysis and architectural reasoning**, not runtime validation or enforcement.

They support structured thinking about system composition under CNIG.

---

## 2. Nature of CNIG Checklists

CNIG checklists are:

- cognitive evaluation guides
- structural reasoning prompts
- pre-execution analytical scaffolding

They are not:

- CI/CD gates
- validation pipelines
- compliance checks
- automated decision systems

---

## 3. Core Checklist Categories

---

### 3.1 Composition Consistency Check

- Do system components remain consistent under composition?
- Does interaction between components introduce new structural behavior?
- Does correctness at the component level imply correctness at system level?

Interpretation focus: **composition effects, not component correctness**

---

### 3.2 Reachability Analysis Check

- What system states become reachable under current composition?
- Are all reachable states structurally anticipated?
- Does composition expand possibility space unintentionally?

Interpretation focus: **emergent state space, not execution paths**

---

### 3.3 Admissibility Boundary Check

- Which reachable states are structurally admissible?
- Are admissibility boundaries stable under composition?
- Do constraints behave consistently across system boundaries?

Interpretation focus: **structural validity, not policy enforcement**

---

### 3.4 Interaction Topology Check (Privilege Surface)

- How does system composition change interaction pathways?
- Are new interaction routes introduced through integration?
- Does system coupling expand or restrict structural reachability?

Interpretation focus: **topological change, not access control**

---

### 3.5 Governance Separation Check

- Is there a clear distinction between local execution and global structure?
- Does governance depend on execution-level behavior?
- Does system structure influence interpretation of correctness?

Interpretation focus: **analytical separation, not architecture separation**

---

## 4. Checklist Usage Principle

These checklists are intended to:

- structure architectural discussion
- guide reasoning about system composition
- surface hidden structural assumptions

They are not intended to:

- approve or reject system changes
- enforce compliance rules
- act as automated decision gates

---

## 5. Interpretation Constraint

A checklist item is not a requirement.

It is a **question that exposes structural assumptions in system design**.

---

## 6. Relationship to CNIG Core

These checklists operate over:

- primitives (structural vocabulary)
- invariants (stability conditions)
- failure modes (deviation patterns)

They do not modify them.

They provide structured access to them in reasoning contexts.

## 7. Transition to Decision Layer

The next layer defines structured decision reasoning templates under CNIG.
