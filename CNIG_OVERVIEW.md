# CNIG Overview

Constraint-Native Infrastructure Governance (CNIG) by Gaurav H. Thanki is a conceptual framework for interpreting system behavior under composition constraints.
---

## 1. What CNIG Is

CNIG is a conceptual framework for reasoning about:

> admissible system states within reachable state space under composition constraints before execution.

It provides a structured way to describe how systems behave when:

- individual components are correct in isolation
- but their composition produces unexpected global outcomes

CNIG is an **interpretive lens for system structure under composition pressure**.

---

## 2. What CNIG Is Not

CNIG is not:

- a runtime system
- a policy engine
- a formal verification tool
- a deployment framework
- a compliance mechanism

It does not execute, enforce, or govern systems.

---

## 3. Core Idea

CNIG focuses on a central structural observation:

> correctness at the component level does not guarantee correctness at the composed system level.

It studies how **system structure shapes the space of possible outcomes before execution occurs**.

---

## 4. Structural Perspective

CNIG views systems through:

- state space (what configurations are possible)
- admissibility (what configurations are structurally coherent)
- composition (how components interact)
- constraints (what shapes interaction boundaries)

Systems are not primarily defined by behavior — but by **structure under combination**.

---

## 5. Core Vocabulary (CNIG Lens)

### Primitives
Concepts used to reason about system structure:
- Reachable State Space
- Admissible System State
- Constraint-Native Governance
- State Transition Validation
- Execution vs Governance Separation
- Privilege Surface

---

### Invariants
Interpretive stability concepts:
- Identity Invariant
- Stability Invariant
- Behavioral Invariant
- Structural Invariant

---

### Failure Modes
Compositional breakdown patterns:
- Governance Capture
- Reference Drift
- Constitutional Fragmentation
- Invariant Overconstraint
- Recursive Governance Instability
- Implicit Reachability Expansion Failure
- Stochastic Drift
- Phase Desynchronization
- Privilege Surface Expansion Failure
- Null State Boundary Violation

---

## 6. How CNIG Is Used

CNIG is used as a lens for:

- reasoning about distributed systems behavior
- analyzing architectural composition risks
- understanding emergent system properties
- describing divergence between local correctness and global outcomes

It is most useful when systems exhibit **non-trivial interaction effects under composition**.

---

## 7. Key Structural Insight

CNIG emphasizes:

- local correctness is insufficient to guarantee global correctness
- system behavior is shaped by interaction topology
- composition creates new possible states not visible at component level

---

## 8. Epistemic Boundary

CNIG is strictly conceptual.

It does not provide:

- implementation guidance
- operational guarantees
- executable specifications

It is a **lens for interpretation, not a mechanism for execution**.

---

## 9. Cross-Framework Compatibility

CNIG is designed to coexist with:

- distributed systems architectures
- policy-as-code systems
- formal verification tools
- observability frameworks

It does not replace them — it provides a structural interpretation layer above them.

---

## 10. Stability Statement

CNIG remains stable when used to:

- reason about composition
- describe system-level behavior
- analyze emergent structure

It degrades when treated as:

- a direct implementation framework
- a runtime system design
- an enforcement mechanism


---

## 11. Final Note

CNIG is not defined by implementation.

It is defined by the **consistency of interpretation across system composition contexts**.
