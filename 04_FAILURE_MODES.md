# CNIG Failure Modes

Constraint-Native Infrastructure Governance (CNIG)

---

## 1. Purpose of This Layer

This layer defines canonical failure modes that emerge when system composition violates or distorts admissibility structure under CNIG.

Failure modes are **descriptive structural outcomes**, not runtime alerts, metrics, or diagnostic rules.

They describe *how systems break under composition*, not how to monitor or fix them.

---

## 2. Nature of Failure Modes

CNIG failure modes are:

- structural interpretations of compositional breakdown
- descriptions of emergent inconsistency patterns
- language for reasoning about system instability

They are not:

- monitoring signals
- incident classifications
- debugging categories
- operational alerts

---

## 3. Core Failure Mode Taxonomy

### 3.1 Governance Capture
System behavior shifts away from intended structural constraints due to emergent interaction dominance.

Governance no longer reflects intended system structure.

---

### 3.2 Reference Drift
Divergence in meaning, interpretation, or constraint definition across system boundaries.

The same structural rule is interpreted differently across components or domains.

---

### 3.3 Constitutional Fragmentation
Breakdown of global structural coherence into incompatible local interpretations.

System loses unified admissibility logic.

---

### 3.4 Invariant Overconstraint
System composition restricts admissible behavior beyond intended structural limits.

Valid system states become unreachable due to compounded constraint interaction.

---

### 3.5 Recursive Governance Instability
Governance evaluation becomes dependent on prior governance evaluation, producing self-referential instability.

Structural validity becomes circular.

---

### 3.6 Implicit Reachability Expansion Failure
System composition introduces new reachable states not represented in the original structural model.

The possibility space expands without explicit structural acknowledgment.

---

### 3.7 Stochastic Drift
System produces divergent outcomes under identical structural conditions due to compositional variability.

Determinism is lost at the system interaction level.

---

### 3.8 Phase Desynchronization
Temporal misalignment between state transitions and their structural interpretation.

System state changes and their evaluation become decoupled in time.

---

### 3.9 Privilege Surface Expansion Failure
Interaction topology expands beyond intended structural boundaries under composition pressure.

New interaction pathways emerge without explicit structural design.

---

### 3.10 Null State Boundary Violation
System reaches a state with no valid continuation under defined structural constraints.

No admissible transition exists from the current state.

---

## 4. Structural Interpretation Rule

Failure modes are not events.

They are **patterns of structural degradation in system composition space**.

They describe geometry of failure, not incidents of failure.

---

## 5. Relationship to Primitives

Failure modes emerge from distortions in:

- Reachable State Space boundaries
- Admissibility constraints
- Privilege Surface expansion
- Execution vs governance separation

They are not independent constructs.

They are expressions of structural imbalance across primitives.

---

## 6. Non-Operational Boundary

Failure modes must not be used as:

- alert definitions
- incident severity classifications
- SRE dashboards
- runtime observability labels

Any such usage is an external interpretation layer, not CNIG itself.

---

## 7. Transition to Application Layer

The next layer introduces reasoning structures used to apply CNIG in structured analysis contexts.
