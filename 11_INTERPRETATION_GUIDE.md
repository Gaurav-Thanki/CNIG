# CNIG Interpretation Guide

Constraint-Native Infrastructure Governance (CNIG)

---

## 1. Purpose of This Layer

This layer defines how CNIG should be read and applied in reasoning contexts.

It is not a usage manual or implementation guide.

It is a **consistency guide for interpretation under CNIG vocabulary**.

---

## 2. Reading Principle

CNIG should be read as:

- a structural lens on system behavior
- a vocabulary for describing composition effects
- a way to articulate pre-execution system reasoning

It should NOT be read as:

- a system design framework
- a runtime architecture model
- a step-by-step engineering methodology

---

## 3. Interpretation Hierarchy

When interpreting CNIG concepts, the following hierarchy applies:

1. Structural meaning (how components relate)
2. Compositional behavior (how interactions emerge)
3. State-space implications (what becomes possible)
4. Failure interpretation (how breakdown is described)

Implementation is explicitly outside this hierarchy.

---

## 4. How to Use CNIG Vocabulary

CNIG terms are used to:

- describe system structure
- articulate emergent behavior
- identify composition-induced effects
- reason about admissibility of system states

They are NOT used to:

- define APIs or schemas
- prescribe system architecture
- enforce runtime constraints
- specify operational logic

---

## 5. Consistency Rule

When using CNIG terms:

- “Invariant” refers to interpretive stability, not enforcement
- “Failure mode” refers to compositional breakdown patterns, not alerts
- “State” refers to structural configuration, not runtime snapshot
- “Transition” refers to conceptual movement in state space, not execution flow

---

## 6. Misinterpretation Guardrail

If CNIG is being used to:

- generate direct implementation code
- define production system behavior
- act as a validation engine
- replace existing engineering frameworks

then CNIG is being misapplied.

In such cases, the interpretation has moved outside its intended boundary.

---

## 7. Integration with Other Frameworks

CNIG is designed to coexist with:

- distributed systems design methodologies
- formal verification tools
- policy-as-code systems
- observability and telemetry frameworks

It does not replace them.

It provides a **higher-order structural lens over them**.

---

## 8. Natural Usage Pattern

In practice, CNIG appears most naturally in:

- architectural discussions
- post-incident analysis
- system design reviews
- reasoning about failure propagation

It is most useful when explaining *why a system behaves unexpectedly under composition*.

---

## 9. Anti-Forcing Principle

CNIG should not be forced into:

- every engineering conversation
- every system design problem
- every abstraction layer

It is only relevant when compositional effects are central to the problem.

---

## 10. Stability Statement

CNIG remains stable when:

- used selectively
- used descriptively
- used to clarify system-level behavior under composition

It becomes unstable when over-applied as a universal explanation layer.

---

## 11. Transition to Assets and Diagrams

The next layer provides visual and structural representations of CNIG concepts.
